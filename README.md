**A Collective of Innovation for Ecology, Intelligence, and Compassion**

Elysia is a public, community-oriented initiative devoted to the protection and revitalization of Earth’s interconnected systems. We combine ethical artificial intelligence, environmental data science, and compassionate systems engineering to foster planetary well-being and social equity.

This repository hosts the central hub for our website and collective identity. It is the primary gateway into our growing ecosystem of research, education, and collaborative conservation technology.
